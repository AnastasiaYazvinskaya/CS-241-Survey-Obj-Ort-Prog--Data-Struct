__Author: Anastasia Yazvinskaya__

## Elevator pitch
_This class covers the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Python. With the help of control tasks (folder "check"), we prepare for solving more complex problems (folder "prove"), which demonstrate our complete understanding of the topic._
_Topics we study:_
- W01 - basics
- W02 - files and functions
- W03-4 - classes and objects
- W05 - event-driven programming
- W06 - classes and objects
- W07 - polymorphism
- W08-9 - encapsulation and properties
- W10 - sorting algorithms
- W11 - encapsulation and properties_

## Outcomes
- basics and OOP in Python
- arcade lib
  --_W04-5 - Ping pong games were created that were controlled with arrows._
  _W06-7 - Skeet games were created that were controlled with the mouse._
  _W_
