# CS241 - Survey Obj Ort Prog/Data Struct

__Author: Anastasia Yazvinskaya__

## Elevator pitch
_This class covers the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Python. With the help of control tasks (folder "check"), we prepare for solving more complex problems (folder "prove"), which demonstrate our complete understanding of the topic._
_Topics we study:_
- W01 - basics
- W02 - files and functions
- W03-4 - classes and objects
- W05 - event-driven programming
- W06 - classes and objects
- W07 - polymorphism
- W08-9 - encapsulation and properties
- W10 - sorting algorithms
- W11 - encapsulation and properties_

## Outcomes
- basics and OOP in Python
- arcade lib (folder "prove"):
  _W05 - Ping pong game were created that were controlled with arrows._
  _W06-7 - Skeet games were created that were controlled with the mouse._
  _W08-11 - An asteroids game were created that were controled with arrows and space_
- team work (folder "team"):
  _We worked as a team to solve programming problems and help each other improve our Python skills._
